# Rockfish
This is a simple chess game implemented in Python with two games modes:
* Human vs. human
* Human vs. computer (in the works)

To play a game simply clone this repo, run `pip install -e .` within the project root directory, then run `rockfish.py`.

The name Rockfish is inspired from the top chess engine Stockfish which won the most recent TCEC season 20. Read more about Stockfish [here](https://stockfishchess.org/ "Stockfish home").
